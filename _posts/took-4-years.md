<p>
It took a week to move<br/>
but 4 years to settle in
</p>

<p>
It took a few months to find friends,<br/>
but years to find those who stayed
</p>

<p>
It took 4 years at work,<br/>
to take on a new challenge
</p>

<p>
It took a lot of trips home,<br/>
and many hard flights back
</p>

<p>
It took patience,<br/>
and a lot of humility
</p>

<p>
and it took a great partner,<br/>
to call it home
</p>

<p>
But it was well worth it.
