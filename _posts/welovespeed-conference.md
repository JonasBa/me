Earlier this week I attended the first ever [WeLoveSpeed](https://www.welovespeed.com/en/2018/) conference in Bordeaux, which was the first ever edition of a conference in France, whose primary focus was web performance.

The talks were insightful and the quality was quite high with participating companies such as Google, Akamai and a number of smaller companies all focusing on performance.

Hearing CTO's of France's biggest news sites, marketplaces and websites in general (such as Ouest-France and l'Equipe) discuss how performance actually increased their revenue and helps them fight competition, as well as hearing that AMP didn't really do anything was a great 1st hand experience.

Hearing all those great talks, I've been inspired to maybe come up for a similar talk next year, but a one evolving around search performance and the impact of network latency on your search click and conversion rates as well as how much does slow UI re-rendering actually hurt your performance. The area has not really been explored that much and I think this is something where Algolia can have a real impact on.

Overall, it's hard to expose a favorite talk, but I've very much enjoyed the one of [Stephanie Walter - Cheating the UX when there is nothing more to optimize](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/pixel-pioneers-cheating-the-ux-when-there-is-nothing-more-to-optimize/) which gave us a great perspective on how users actually feel about speed as well as how to incorporate performance into our design and UX mindset!

I've had the amazing opportunity to give a talk about the what are some of the optimizations we do on Algolia's websites that help us deliver a fast experience and user satisfaction, similar to the one on provided by our search. If you are interested in the talk, you can view the slides <a href="/conference/welovespeed/welovespeed.html#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (and please send feedback if you have it, I always look to improve my talks!) + a big thanks to everyone who listened and tweeted about it.

A big thank you to the organizers, this could not have been better!

I really mean it, you've clearly put a lot of effort and thought into making this conference happen by providing everything needed prior and during the conference!
